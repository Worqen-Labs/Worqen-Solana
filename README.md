# Worqen Escrow

Trustless payment escrow and direct‑pay settlement for the [Worqen](https://worqen.com) job marketplace, written in Rust with the [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com) framework on Solana. Employers lock funds in a program‑owned vault when they hire; workers are paid only after confirmation, with **platform‑mediated dispute resolution** and a permissionless **deadline safety net** so funds can never be stranded by an unresponsive platform. The program settles in native **SOL** and an **allowlisted set of SPL stablecoins** (USDC / USDT / EURC), charges a **fee‑on‑top commission** routed to a dedicated treasury, and also offers a non‑escrow **direct‑pay** path (single, batch, and tips) for trusted hires.

## 2. Core concepts

### The three‑party model + the treasury

Every escrow names three roles plus a separate fee destination:

| Role | What it is | Can it sign? | Does it hold money? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **employer** | The payer. Creates, funds, confirms, and (in `Created`) cancels the escrow. | Yes | No (funds live in the vault PDA) |
| **employee** | The worker. Receives the worker `amount` in full. | Yes (confirm, self‑release after both confirm) | Receives payouts |
| **platform_authority** | Per‑escrow **hot ops key** (the Worqen backend). Resolves disputes, cancels funded escrows, force/auto‑releases, rotates keys. | Yes | **No — it never receives commission** |
| **fee_recipient** | The **treasury** (`Config.fee_recipient`, snapshotted onto each escrow at create). Receives all commission. | **Never signs** | Receives commission only |

The strict separation between the **ops key** (`platform_authority`, hot, signs) and the **treasury** (`fee_recipient`, cold, never signs) means a compromise of the operations key cannot redirect funds to itself.

### The global Config PDA

A singleton account at PDA `[b"config"]` holds platform‑wide state:

- **Mint allowlist** — up to 30 SPL mints permitted for escrow and direct‑pay. Native SOL is always allowed and is not stored.
- **Pause kill‑switch** — when `paused = true`, it blocks **only new money entering the system** (`create_escrow`, `deposit_*`, `pay_with_commission_*`, batch pay). It can **never** block release, dispute, auto‑release, settle, or close — so a pause can never strand user funds.
- **Default commission** (`default_commission_bps`) and the **treasury** (`fee_recipient`).
- **Two‑step admin handoff** — `update_config(new_pending_authority)` then `accept_authority` (signed by the pending key). Prevents handing the keys to a typo'd address.

### Fee‑on‑top commission model

Commission is **on top of** the worker's pay, never deducted from it. The worker always receives the full `amount`.

```
employer deposits  =  amount  +  commission
worker receives    =  amount                  (in full)
treasury receives  =  commission              ( = amount * bps / 10000, floored )
```

| Tier | bps | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | `500` | 5% | `Escrow::DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE_BPS` |
| Prime (subscriber) | `150` | 1.5% | `Escrow::PRIME_COMMISSION_RATE_BPS` — backend passes the effective bps per call |
| Tip | `200` | 2% | `Escrow::TIP_COMMISSION_RATE_BPS` |
| **Hard cap** | `1000` | **10%** | `Escrow::MAX_COMMISSION_RATE_BPS` — enforced on‑chain; any higher rate is rejected |

The tier constants are informational; the **effective `bps` is supplied per instruction by the backend** and only the 10% cap is enforced on chain. Freelancers pay nothing — the employer pays the fee.

### Per‑milestone escrow + grouping

Escrows are **per‑milestone**, not per‑hire. A multi‑milestone hire creates one escrow per milestone, linked off‑chain by `escrow_group_id` (an off‑chain SHA‑256 of the hire id), with `sequence_in_group` / `total_in_group` so an indexer can collect all milestones of a hire without an off‑chain join. Ungrouped escrows set the group id to zero bytes and the sequence/total to 0.

An `escrow_kind` tag (`u8`, not a closed enum so new kinds can be added without a schema migration) classifies the product flow: `MILESTONE = 0`, `HOURLY = 1`, `RETAINER = 2`, `OTHER = 255`.

### PDAs

| PDA | Seeds | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Escrow** | `[b"escrow", escrow_id]` | The escrow state account (`escrow_id` = random 32 bytes from the backend) |
| **Vault** | `[b"vault", escrow_account_key]` | The locked funds — native SOL directly, or an SPL ATA owned by the escrow PDA |
| **Config** | `[b"config"]` | The singleton global config |

> **Bump gotcha:** SOL CPIs from the vault sign with `vault_bump`; SPL token CPIs sign with `escrow.bump` (the escrow PDA is the ATA authority). Mixing them surfaces as "unauthorized signer".

### Escrow lifecycle / state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: create_escrow
    Created --> Funded: deposit_sol / deposit_token
    Created --> Cancelled: cancel_escrow_* (employer or platform)
    Funded --> Funded: deposit_more_* (top-up)
    Funded --> PendingRelease: confirm_completion (first confirm)
    Funded --> Released: release_* / release_partial_* (final)
    Funded --> Disputed: raise_dispute (either party)
    Funded --> Resolved: mutual_cancel_* (both sign)
    Funded --> Cancelled: cancel_escrow_* (platform only)
    PendingRelease --> Released: release_* / release_partial_* (final)
    PendingRelease --> Disputed: raise_dispute (employer only)
    PendingRelease --> Resolved: mutual_cancel_* (both sign)
    Disputed --> Resolved: resolve_dispute_* (platform)
    Disputed --> Resolved: trigger_auto_release_* (anyone, after deadline)
    Released --> [*]: close_escrow_*
    Resolved --> [*]: close_escrow_*
    Cancelled --> [*]: close_escrow_* / close_unfunded_escrow_*
```

`Released`, `Resolved`, and `Cancelled` are terminal. Rent is reclaimed by closing a terminal escrow.

## 3. Flows

### (a) Fixed‑price escrow — happy path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Employer
    participant P as Program
    participant V as Vault PDA
    participant W as Worker
    participant T as Treasury
    E->>P: create_escrow (amount, bps, kind=MILESTONE)
    E->>P: deposit_sol  (amount + commission)
    P->>V: lock funds  -> Funded
    W->>P: confirm_completion  -> PendingRelease
    E->>P: confirm_completion
    E->>P: release_sol (ref_id)
    P->>W: amount (in full)
    P->>T: commission
    Note over P: status -> Released
    E->>P: close_escrow_sol  (reclaim rent + dust)
```

`release_*` is authorized for: the **employer** (after `employer_confirmed`), the **platform_authority**, or the **worker** once *both* parties have confirmed (covers the "employer confirmed then went silent" case without a dispute).

### (b) Multi‑milestone

The backend creates N escrows sharing one `escrow_group_id`, each with `sequence_in_group ∈ [1, total_in_group]`. Each milestone funds, confirms, and releases independently following flow (a). Indexers reassemble the hire from the group id.

### (c) Escrowed hourly / retainer (top‑up + draw‑down)

For ongoing work, create with `escrow_kind = HOURLY` or `RETAINER`, fund a starting block, then:

- **Top up** a `Funded` escrow with `deposit_more_sol` / `deposit_more_token` — raises `amount`, recomputes commission on the new total, and charges only the delta.
- **Draw down** with `release_partial_sol` / `release_partial_token` per approved worklog or invoice. Each partial pays the worker `amount` plus the *delta* of cumulative commission, so the sum of partial commissions equals a single full‑release commission for the same total. A non‑final partial must leave the vault at 0 or above the rent‑exempt minimum (else `PartialReleaseLeavesDust`); the final slice drains the vault and flips status to `Released`. `ref_id` on each release ties a draw‑down to its off‑chain worklog/invoice.

### (d) Direct pay (non‑escrow, fee‑on‑top)

For trusted hires and approved‑invoice settlement, `pay_with_commission_sol` / `pay_with_commission_token` atomically pays the worker the full `amount` and a commission on top to the treasury in one transaction — **no escrow, no lock, no state persisted**. Indexers rely on the `DirectPaymentMade` event. Subject to the pause switch and (for tokens) the mint allowlist.

### (e) Batch payout to many recipients

`batch_pay_with_commission_sol` / `batch_pay_with_commission_token` fan out a single fee‑on‑top direct payment to **up to 16 recipients** in one atomic transaction (team payouts, referral fees). Recipient accounts/ATAs are passed via `remaining_accounts`, positionally aligned with the `amounts` vector; one commission on the total goes to the treasury. No recipient may equal the payer.

### (f) Dispute → resolve, and the auto‑release safety net

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Party as Employer / Worker
    participant P as Program
    participant Plat as platform_authority
    participant Anyone as Anyone
    Party->>P: raise_dispute(reason, deadline in [+3d,+90d]) -> Disputed
    alt Platform mediates in time
        Plat->>P: resolve_dispute_*(employee_share)
        P-->>P: split worker amount; commission refunded to employer -> Resolved
    else Deadline passes, platform silent
        Anyone->>P: trigger_auto_release_* (permissionless)
        P-->>P: pay worker remaining amount; commission refunded to employer -> Resolved (forced=true)
    end
```

`dispute_deadline` is **mandatory** and bounded to `[now + 3 days, now + 90 days]`. The 3‑day minimum guarantees the platform always has time to mediate before anyone can force‑resolve (this closes a self‑dispute‑then‑instant‑payout hole). After the deadline, **anyone** can call `trigger_auto_release_*` to pay the worker — the platform forfeits commission on any dispute, so it has no incentive to stall. In `Funded` either party may dispute; in `PendingRelease` only the employer may (the worker is already committed by the prior confirm).

### (g) Mutual cancel (amicable settle, both sign)

`mutual_cancel_sol` / `mutual_cancel_token` lets the **employer and employee both sign** to split a non‑terminal (`Funded` / `PendingRelease`) escrow without a dispute or platform involvement. `employee_share` (≤ remaining worker amount) goes to the worker; the remainder, the commission refund, and any dust go to the employer. Status → `Resolved`.

### (h) Cancel + close / close‑unfunded (rent recovery)

- **Cancel** (`cancel_escrow_*`): in `Created`, the employer or platform may cancel; once `Funded`, **only the platform** may cancel (the employer must dispute instead of unilaterally reclaiming funds the worker may have started against). Full vault refund to employer.
- **Close** (`close_escrow_*`): on a terminal escrow, employer **or** platform sweeps any vault dust and refunds the escrow account's rent (~0.005 SOL) to the employer.
- **Close‑unfunded** (`close_unfunded_escrow_*`): reclaims rent on a `Cancelled` escrow that was **never funded** (`funded_at == 0`); for SOL no vault is involved, for tokens no vault ATA was ever created.

### (i) Tips

A tip is just a direct payment at the tip rate: `pay_with_commission_*` with `commission_bps = 200` (2%). No escrow account is involved.

## 7. Money math

```rust
commission           = floor(amount * commission_rate_bps / 10000)   // u128 intermediate
total_deposit        = amount + commission                            // checked add
remaining_worker     = amount - released_to_employee                  // saturating
remaining_commission = commission_amount - floor(released_to_employee * bps / 10000)
```

All SOL payout/refund/dispute/settle paths **drain the vault to its actual balance**, not the recorded amounts. This sweeps any dust someone sent to the vault directly and guarantees the vault ends at exactly 0 — Solana rejects an account left below the rent‑exempt minimum but above zero, so draining to actual balance is what makes the program dust‑DoS safe.

---

## 8. Security model

- **Role separation.** The treasury (`fee_recipient`) **never signs** — it is a cold, receive‑only key. The per‑escrow `platform_authority` is a **hot ops key that never holds fees**, decoupled from the treasury. The commission destination is snapshotted at create time, so a later Config change can never re‑route an in‑flight escrow.
- **Upgrade authority.** On devnet a single file key (acceptable for devnet); **on mainnet the upgrade authority and Config authority must be a Squads multisig / HSM** (transfer post‑deploy with `solana program set-upgrade-authority`). Config admin uses a **two‑step handoff** so the keys can never be sent to a wrong address.
- **Drain‑actual‑balance.** All SOL release/resolve/cancel/settle paths transfer the vault's *real* lamport balance, defeating dust‑deposit DoS that would otherwise strand a vault below the rent‑exempt minimum.
- **Mint allowlist.** Only SOL plus an admin‑curated set of SPL mints are accepted. **Accepted‑stablecoin freeze risk:** USDC/USDT/EURC carry an issuer freeze authority; a frozen vault ATA or recipient ATA could block a transfer. The allowlist limits exposure to vetted issuers, and the deadline safety net plus close paths bound the blast radius.
- **Minimum dispute window.** A mandatory 3‑day floor on `dispute_deadline` guarantees the platform always has time to mediate before anyone can permissionlessly force‑resolve — closing the self‑dispute‑then‑instant‑payout hole. The platform forfeits commission on any dispute, removing any incentive to stall.
- **Pause that can't strand funds.** The kill‑switch only blocks new money; releases, disputes, auto‑release, settle, and close are always available.
- **`security_txt`.** The program embeds a [`solana-security-txt`](https://github.com/neodyme-labs/solana-security-txt) block: contact `security@worqen.com`, policy and source on GitHub, **`auditors: "Pending external audit"`**.
- **Forward compatibility.** Both accounts carry a `version` byte and 64‑byte `reserved` padding so additive fields can be introduced in a future upgrade without a realloc; `escrow_kind` is a `u8` (not a closed enum) so new product flows need no schema migration.

> **Audit status:** *Pending external audit.* Do not deploy to mainnet with real funds until the audit is complete and the upgrade/config authorities are multisig.

For the full rationale behind every hardening decision, see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) and the security‑driven release notes in [`devnet-deployment.json`](./devnet-deployment.json).

## 9. Build, test, deploy

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable toolchain)
- Solana CLI 4.0 (SBF program built with platform‑tools 1.53)
- Anchor 0.32.1 (`avm use 0.32.1`)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (package manager + test runner)

### Build & test

```bash
bun install           # install TS deps
anchor build          # compiles the program + generates the IDL/types
bun test              # runs the full suite in-process via LiteSVM (no validator)
```

Tests run **in-process with [LiteSVM](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/testing/litesvm)** — fast, deterministic, no local validator or devnet needed. Because LiteSVM can warp the on‑chain clock, the suite also covers **time‑locked paths** (e.g. `trigger_auto_release_*` after the dispute deadline) that a live validator can't easily test. Every instruction is exercised. (`anchor test` simply invokes `bun test`.)

### Deploy to devnet

```bash
anchor build
solana program deploy \
  --program-id target/deploy/worqen_escrow-keypair.json \
  --url devnet \
  target/deploy/worqen_escrow.so
```

### Initialize on a fresh cluster

```ts
// 1. Create the global Config (signer becomes admin authority)
await program.methods
  .initConfig(feeRecipient, 500 /* default bps */, [] /* allowed mints */)
  .accounts({ authority: admin.publicKey })
  .rpc()

// 2. Allowlist the stablecoin mints (run once per mint)
await program.methods.addAllowedMint(USDC_MINT).accounts({ authority: admin.publicKey }).rpc()
await program.methods.addAllowedMint(USDT_MINT).accounts({ authority: admin.publicKey }).rpc()
await program.methods.addAllowedMint(EURC_MINT).accounts({ authority: admin.publicKey }).rpc()
```

**Reference mints** (from `devnet-deployment.json`):

| Token | Mainnet | Devnet |
|---|---|---|
| USDC | `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` | `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU` |
| USDT | `Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB` | (no devnet mint — alias to USDC) |
| EURC | `HzwqbKZw8HxMN6bF2yFZNrht3c2iXXzpKcFu7uBEDKtr` | `HzwqbKZw8HxMN6bF2yFZNrht3c2iXXzpKcFu7uBEDKtr` |

### Verified build (mainnet path)

For mainnet, ship a **verifiable build** so anyone can confirm the on‑chain bytecode matches this source:

```bash
solana-verify build                                   # reproducible (Docker) build
solana-verify verify-from-repo --remote -um \
  --program-id <program-id> <github-repo-url>         # writes the on-chain verification
```

Or run `make verify-devnet` / `scripts/verify.sh`.

Use a fresh secure program keypair, update `declare_id!` + `Anchor.toml`, and deploy with a Squads multisig as both upgrade and config authority.

### Continuous integration & deployment

Three GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **`ci.yml`** | every push / PR to `main` | `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, `anchor build`, and the **full per‑instruction LiteSVM suite via `bun test`** (in‑process, no validator). The merge gate. |
| **`deploy.yml`** | manual (`workflow_dispatch`) | Builds, **upgrades the devnet program in place**, refreshes the on‑chain IDL, and re‑runs the LiteSVM suite on the built artifact. Gated by the `devnet` environment. |
| **`release.yml`** | tag `v*` | **Reproducible `solana-verify` build**, publishes the `.so` + IDL + hashes as a **GitHub Release**, and (behind the protected `mainnet-beta` environment) writes a verified **buffer for the Squads multisig** to execute the mainnet upgrade. |

Required secrets (set per **Environment** in repo settings):

| Secret | Environment | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DEVNET_AUTHORITY_KEYPAIR` | `devnet` | JSON byte‑array of the devnet upgrade authority (deploy + IDL + fee payer). |
| `MAINNET_DEPLOYER_KEYPAIR` | `mainnet-beta` | Funded fee payer used **only** to write the upgrade buffer (never the authority). |
| `MAINNET_PROGRAM_ID` | `mainnet-beta` | The mainnet program id. |
| `MAINNET_UPGRADE_MULTISIG` | `mainnet-beta` | Squads multisig that receives buffer authority and executes the upgrade. |

Configure the `mainnet-beta` environment with **required reviewers** so every mainnet release needs manual approval.

## 10. FAQ

**Who pays the commission?**
The employer. Commission is charged *on top of* the worker's pay, so the freelancer always receives the full `amount` and effectively pays **0%**.

**How does a Prime subscriber get 1.5%?**
The on‑chain program only enforces the 10% hard cap; the **effective bps is passed per call by the backend**. For a Prime employer the backend passes `150` instead of the standard `500`.

**How is hourly / invoice billing done on‑chain?**
Create with `escrow_kind = HOURLY` or `RETAINER`, top up with `deposit_more_*`, and pay out approved time in slices with `release_partial_*`. Each partial carries a `ref_id` linking it to the off‑chain worklog or invoice. For trusted relationships, `pay_with_commission_*` settles an approved invoice in one shot with no lock.

**Can a company (B2B) use it?**
Yes. The `employer` is just a wallet — a company wallet works the same as an individual. The `terms_hash` field can anchor a signed SOW or contract for dispute evidence.

**Can I pay a whole team in one transaction?**
Yes — `batch_pay_with_commission_*` fans out to up to **16 recipients** atomically with a single commission on the total. Per‑recipient amounts are positionally aligned with the recipient accounts in `remaining_accounts`.

**What happens if a party goes silent?**
- *Employer confirmed then disappears:* once both parties confirm, the **worker** can self‑release.
- *Platform fails to mediate a dispute:* after `dispute_deadline` (3–90 days), **anyone** can call `trigger_auto_release_*` to pay the worker. Funds are never permanently frozen.

**Can the platform steal funds?**
No. The treasury never signs, and the hot `platform_authority` can only **split** disputed funds between the actual employer and employee accounts (both verified on‑chain against the escrow) — it can never pay itself. On mainnet the upgrade/config authority is a multisig, so no single key can change program behavior.

**What if my USDC account is frozen?**
USDC/USDT/EURC carry an issuer freeze authority, so a frozen ATA can block a token transfer — an inherent property of those tokens, not the program. The mint allowlist limits exposure to vetted issuers; native SOL is never freezable.

**Is the program upgradeable, and who controls it?**
Yes, via the BPF upgradeable loader. On devnet a single key controls upgrades; **on mainnet this must be a Squads multisig / HSM**, and Config admin changes go through a two‑step handoff.

**What's the cost per escrow?**
Roughly **~0.005 SOL** of rent for the escrow account (plus a small vault), fully **refundable** by calling `close_escrow_*` (or `close_unfunded_escrow_*` for a never‑funded one) once the escrow is terminal.

**Which tokens are supported?**
Native **SOL** (always) plus the **admin‑curated SPL allowlist** (up to 30 mints) — in production, USDC, USDT, and EURC.

**Is it audited?**
Not yet — status is **pending external audit**. Do not put real funds on mainnet until the audit completes and authorities are multisig.

**How do disputes work and what is the deadline?**
Either party (employer‑only after a confirm) raises a dispute with a mandatory deadline in `[now + 3 days, now + 90 days]`, freezing funds. The platform resolves by splitting the remaining worker amount (commission is refunded to the employer). If the platform never acts, anyone can force‑resolve in the worker's favor after the deadline.

**Can the employer cancel after funding?**
No. Once `Funded`, only the **platform** may cancel; the employer must raise a dispute instead. In the `Created` (pre‑deposit) state, the employer can cancel freely. Both parties can also `mutual_cancel_*` together at any non‑terminal stage.
